= Helperful

Helperful aims to be a collection of useful and reusable Rails helpers.


== Getting Started

Helper methods are grouped into different files according to their scope.

Before using an helper method you should include the helper file in your Rails application,
exactly how you would proceed to include a default Rails helper.

  class MyController < ApplicationController

    # include the title_helper helper collection
    helper :title

    # include the title_helper helper collection
    # using the module name
    helper TitleHelper

  end

See the Rails documentation for <tt>ActionController::Base#helper</tt> method
for more details about how to include an helper into a Rails application.

Once included, all helper methods are available in the View.

  <html>
    <title><%= title 'This is a title' %></title>
    <body>
      <%= yield %>
    </body>
  </html>


== Helpers

This is a short description of all available helpers.
Please referer to the documentation available at the beginning of any helper file for further details.

=== Title Helper

Provides an helper for managing page title in Rails views and layouts.

  # Include the helper in your controller.
  # You might want to include it in ApplicationController to make it available
  # to all controllers and actions.
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

    helper :title

  end

  # Now you can use set a title in your action
  # Example. index.html.rb
  <h1><%= title 'This is a title' %></h1>

  # And print the title with a :site decorator in your layout.
  <html>
    <title><%= title :site => 'My Cool Site!' %></title>
    <body>
      <%= yield %>
    </body>
  </html>
