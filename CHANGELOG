== master

* ADDED: Added HelperfulContentHelper module with #sidebar helper for passing content_for :sidebar to the layout. Even if this is a really simple method, this method adds a bit of semantic meaning to common application usage of content_for for created sidebars.

* CHANGED: Renamed TitleHelper to HelperfulTitleHelper to prevent conflicts with other common helpers.


== Release 0.1.0

* ADDED: Imported TitleHelper from Gist.
